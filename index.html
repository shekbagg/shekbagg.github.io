		<h1>Shekhar Raju</h1>

		<p>I am currently working towards founding <a href="https://www.trada.io" target="_blank">Trada</a>, an online wholesale marketplace that connects craft brands and makers with independent retailers across Australia 🇦🇺. <br/><br/>I was previously leading an engineering team at <a href="https://www.tradegecko.com" target="_blank">TradeGecko</a> where I got to do a deep dive into the global commerce industry 📦. I am deeply passionate about building products, and mostly design software using Ruby, Swift, Objective C and dabble in JS every once in a while.
		<br><br>
		I graduated 🎓 from the <a href="http://nus.edu.sg" target="_blank">National University of Singapore</a> in 2015 with a B.E. (First Class) in Computer Engineering and a minor in Supply Chain Management.
		Previously interned at <a href="http://apple.com" target="_blank">Apple</a> (Cupertino) and <a href="http://www.hgst.com" target="_blank">Western Digital</a> (Bangalore).
		</p>

		<p>Tech enthusiast and a connoisseur of good design. In my free time I dabble in amateur travel photography 📷, keep an eye on geo-politics 🌏 or head out into the mountains for a trek 🏔.</p>
