		<h1>Shekhar Raju</h1>

		<p>Hi ðŸ‘‹. I currently work as a Senior Product Manager at <a href="https://www.intuit.com" target="_blank">Intuit</a> on <a href="https://quickbooks.intuit.com/quickbooks-commerce/" target="_blank">QuickBooks Commerce</a> (formerly TradeGecko). I am also the co-founder of <a href="https://www.trada.io" target="_blank">Trada</a>, an online wholesale marketplace that connects craft brands and makers with independent retailers across Australia. <br/><br/>Before moving into product management, I was leading engineering teams at <a href="https://www.tradegecko.com" target="_blank">TradeGecko</a> on projects ranging from mobile (iOS) to growth engineering. I am deeply passionate about building product and solving challenging customer problems. In my free time I still dabble in Ruby, JS and Swift.
		<br><br>
		I graduated from the <a href="http://nus.edu.sg" target="_blank">National University of Singapore</a> in 2015 with a B.E. (First Class, Dean's list) in Computer Engineering and a minor in Business.
		Previously interned at <a href="http://apple.com" target="_blank">Apple</a> (Cupertino, CA) and <a href="http://www.hgst.com" target="_blank">Western Digital</a> (Bangalore).
		</p>

		<p>I am a self confessed consumer tech enthusiast, amateur photographer and geo political observer. If you ever invite me to head out into the mountains for a hike, I will say yes.</p>
