I am currently a junior pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering at the National University of Singapore.<br><br>
I am currently on student exchange at the University of Texas at Austin until May 2014, after which I will be doing a summer internship at Apple Inc with the Mac OSX team until August 2014.
<br><br>
I am deeply interested in web application development and UI/UX design. I have built a number of projects that showcase this interest. Do check them out.
<br><br>
I can be reached via facebook or email. I am always interested in exciting projects/internships, so do have a look at my resume.
<br><br>
Cheers!
